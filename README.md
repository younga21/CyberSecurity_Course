### Azure Cloud Lab

This repository is a lab overview of my Azure Cloud Project created for Michigan State Cybersecurity Bootcamp. In this lab, I created an ELK stack, Elastic Logstash and Kibana, and the DVWA, Damn Vulnerable Web Application within docker containers that were built out inside of an Ansible container.
